     <p class="title"><b>Roma</b></p>
     <span>The most internationally recognized symbol of Rome, the Colosseum has a long and bloody history. It was inaugurated in 80 A.D. with 100 days of games, including gladiatorial combats and animal fights. It was the largest amphitheater in the Roman Empire and is believed to have packed up to 50,000 people inside. Despite centuries of neglect—it was used as a quarry until the eighteenth century—it has remained intact (for the most part). Today nearly 4 million people visit annually. Buy your tickets in advance or be prepared to wait in a very long line. A combined ticket for the Roman Forum, Colosseum, and Palatine Hill grants access to all three sites and lets you skip the line at the Colosseum.

     <span>This instantly recognisable statue sitting on a rock next to the Langelinie promenade is surely the most famous landmark in the city. The sculptor Edvard Eriksen created the mermaid in 1913 as a tribute to the author Hans Christian Andersen, and it’s inspired by Andersen’s eponymous fairytale. When you get up close to the statue what will surprise you is how small it actually is, but you’ll have to take a photo because it’s simply one of those international identifiers.

     <span> Spend an evening exploring the world’s tallest tower, the 634-metre-high (2,080-foot) Tokyo Skytree. Check out the boutiques on your way up to the observation decks, where you’ll get unrivalled 360-degree views of the city; on clear days, you might even be able to see Mount Fuji. Skytree Town (also known as Solamachi) at the base of the tower is where you’ll find many shopping and dining options.
